  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
  <p>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em><strong>technical sophistication</strong></em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error
    messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement,

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <h2>Founders</h2>
  <p> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
    <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

  <p> Well a long time ago in a not so distance land lived a boy who didn't know what he wanted to eat that day. I am curious if softwrap is going to work ... look at that it did! Good job on chaning the setting in atom! <em><strong>You are a turkey</strong></em>    Take a look at yourself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)" target="_blank">Here</a>
